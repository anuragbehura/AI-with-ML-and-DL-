First you have to download all python files.
If you use pip, you can install NumPy with:
pip install numpy
Also when using pip, itâ€™s good practice to use a virtual environment - see Reproducible Installs below for why, and this guide for details on using virtual environments.
Then run the python file name Train.py.
After running the Train.py file it's gonna create a TrainData.pth file.
After that go to Horizon.py and run the py file.
Then chat with Horizon AI.
